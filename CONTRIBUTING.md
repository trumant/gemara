# Contributing to SCI

The project welcomes your contributions whether they be:

* reporting an [issue](https://github.com/revanite-io/sci/issues/new/choose)
* making a code contribution ([create a fork](https://github.com/revanite-io/sci/fork))
* updating our [docs](https://github.com/revanite-io/sci/blob/main/README.md)

## PR guidelines

All changes to the repository should be made via PR ([OSPS-AC-03](https://baseline.openssf.org/#osps-ac-03)).

PRs MUST meet the following criteria:

* Clear title that conforms to the [Conventional Commits spec](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
* Descriptive commit message
* DCO signoff (via `git commit -s` -- [OSPS-LE-01](https://baseline.openssf.org/#osps-le-01))
* All checks must pass ([OSPS-QA-04](https://baseline.openssf.org/#osps-qa-04))

### Useful make tasks when making schema changes

Use `make lintcue` to validate the syntax of your changes. If you forget to do this before opening a PR and your changes are invalid, the [CI workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) will fail and alert you. Use `make cuegen` to regenerate `go` types based on your changes.

### Useful make tasks when making go changes

Use `make covcheck` to run all tests and ensure test coverage meets our target (85%).

### Generated Code

This project contains both schema and Go code. Some of that go, specifically the contents of [layer2/generated_types.go](layer2/generated_types.go) is generated by `make cuegen` based on the `cue` schema contents in [schemas/](/schemas).

If you change any schema, ensure you run `make cuegen` and commit the result of that generation as part of your PR. If you forget to do this, the [CI workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) will fail and remind you.
