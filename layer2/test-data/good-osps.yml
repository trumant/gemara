      control system and CI/CD pipelines. These controls help
      ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive

              like the Linux kernel's, where changes are first proposed in another
              repository, and merging changes into the primary repository requires a

          Documenting project roles and responsibilities helps project participants,
          potential contributors, and downstream consumers have an accurate
          understanding of who is working on the project and what areas of authority
          they may have.

              When the project has made a release, the project MUST perform a

              as downstream consumers that the project understands what problems
              could arise within the software. Understanding what threats could be
              realized helps the project manage and address risk. This information

              Threat modeling is an activity where the project looks at the 
              codebase, associated processes and infrastructure, interfaces, key
              components and "thinks like a hacker" and brainstorms how the system
              be be broken or compromised. Each identified threat is listed out so
              the project can then think about how to proactively avoid or close off
              any gaps/vulnerabilities that could arise.

              While active, the project documentation MUST include a policy that
              defines a threshold for remediation of SAST findings.
            applicability:
              - Maturity Level 3
            recommendation: |
              Document a policy in the project that defines a threshold for
              remediation of Static Application Security Testing (SAST) findings.
              Include the process for identifying, prioritizing, and remediating
              these findings.

              While active, all changes to the project's codebase MUST be
              automatically evaluated against a documented policy for security
              weaknesses and blocked in the event of violations except when declared
              and suppressed as non-exploitable.
            applicability:
              - Maturity Level 3
            recommendation: |
              Create a status check in the project's version control system that
              runs a Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool on all changes
              to the codebase. Require that the status check passes before changes
              can be merged.
